2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_01second/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_01second/BCD1[3]_i_1/O, cell clk_01second/BCD1[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_counting_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_counting_reg_i_2/O, cell next_counting_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_machine__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_machine_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell next_machine_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk_01second/BCD1[3]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
BCD0_reg[0], BCD0_reg[1], BCD0_reg[2], BCD0_reg[3], BCD1_reg[0],
BCD1_reg[1], BCD1_reg[2], BCD1_reg[3], BCD2_reg[0], BCD2_reg[1],
BCD2_reg[2], BCD2_reg[3], BCD3_reg[0], BCD3_reg[1], BCD3_reg[2]
 (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>
