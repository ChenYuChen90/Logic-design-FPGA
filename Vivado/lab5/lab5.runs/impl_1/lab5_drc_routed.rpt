2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell DISPLAY_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_05/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_05/machine_state[2]_i_1/O, cell clk_05/machine_state[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_05/clock_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_05/price[5]_i_3/O, cell clk_05/price[5]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk_05/machine_state[2]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
machine_state_reg[0], machine_state_reg[1], machine_state_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk_05/price[5]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 28 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
cycle_reg[0], cycle_reg[1], cycle_reg[2], little_reg[0], little_reg[1],
little_reg[2], little_reg[3], little_reg[4], mem0_reg[0], mem0_reg[1],
mem0_reg[2], mem0_reg[3], mem3_reg[0], mem3_reg[1], mem3_reg[2]
 (the first 15 of 28 listed)
Related violations: <none>
