2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk25/num_reg[24]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk25/clk_FSM_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell clk25/clk_FSM_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_FSM is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin BCD1[3]_i_2/O, cell BCD1[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_led_reg[15]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_led_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell next_led_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT BCD1[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
BCD1_reg[0], BCD1_reg[1], BCD1_reg[2], BCD1_reg[3], BCD2_reg[0],
BCD2_reg[1], BCD2_reg[2], BCD2_reg[3], BCD3_reg[0], BCD3_reg[1],
BCD3_reg[2], BCD4_reg[0]
Related violations: <none>
